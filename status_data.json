{"status": "Good Service reluctance to provide specific details concerning the incident at Wimbledon. This is an example of an opaque communication strategy, which can be frustrating for those seeking clarity. Given the information available, we've applied the most appropriate and generalized response to the scenario. We will continue to monitor the situation for any updates that might provide more granular information, which would in turn allow for a more precise description of the cause and extent of the disruption. We appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter.", "reason": "Sunday 19 October, including the last westbound train early on Sunday morning, no service between Turnham Green and Richmond.
