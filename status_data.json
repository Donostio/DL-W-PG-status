{"status": "Good Service mitigated by no reason given for any disruption so good service is indeed accurate. Therefore status is good and all clear. This is aligned with rule 2 of the problem statement. The problem asks for status and reason for the journey: Wimbledon to Parsons Green District line. TFL Status: Good Service TFL Reason: If the TFL status is "Good Service" and the reason text mentions a disruption on a different part of the line that does NOT affect the Wimbledon to Parsons Green journey, the new status should be "Good Service" and the reason should be "All clear." Based on TFL status and no TFL reason this can be categorized as a Good Service and All Clear. Therefore, the result should be: {"status":"Good Service","reason":"All clear."}", "reason": ""}
